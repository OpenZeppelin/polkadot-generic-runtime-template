= Sending Cross-Chain Messages between Parachains

The supported way to exchange cross-chain messages (XCM) between parachains is via Hierarchical Relay Message Passing (HRMP) channels.

For full connectivity between two parachains, two HRMP channels must be opened because each HRMP channel is unidirectional. One channel is reserved exclusively for sending outgoing XCM while the other is reserved exclusively for receiving incoming XCM.

TODO: is this stuff also required for system parachains? or how do system parachains agree to accept? is it automatic?

== Steps to Open an HRMP Channel

> sender calls proposeOpen
