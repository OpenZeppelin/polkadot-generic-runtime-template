= pallet_balances

Branch/Release: `release-polkadot-v1.3.0`

== Purpose

The Balances pallet provides functions for:

* Getting and setting free balances.
* Retrieving total, reserved and unreserved balances.
* Repatriating a reserved balance to a beneficiary account that exists.
* Transferring a balance between accounts (when not reserved).
* Slashing an account balance.
* Account creation and removal.
* Managing total issuance.
* Setting and managing locks.

== Glossary

* Freeze -- What is the difference between Freeze and Hold?
* Hold -- reserving/holding an amount of balance from an account. The `Hold` amount cannot be spent, but still belongs to the account.
* Reserve -- Deprecated, use Hold
* Lock -- Same as `Hold`, with 2 differences:
** Locks can store the reason for the locking operation
** Locks are overlapping, whereas Reserve/Hold's are additive. Example:
*** Apply `Hold` to account A for 20 unit, then apply another `Hold` to account A for 10 unit -> a total of 30 unit will be reserved/hold
*** Apply `Lock` to account A for 20 unit, then apply another `Lock` to account A for 10 unit -> a total of 20 unit will be locked, since 10 is smaller than 20.

* Pallet-specific configs
** `RuntimeHoldReason` -- The overarching hold reason.
** `RuntimeFreezeReason` -- The overarching freeze reason.
** `Balance` -- The balance of an account
** `DustRemoval` -- Handler for the unbalanced reduction when removing a dust account.
** `ExistentialDeposit` -- The minimum amount required to keep an account open. MUST BE GREATER THAN ZERO!
** `AccountStore` -- The means of storing the balances of an account.
** `ReserveIdentifier` --  The ID type for reserves. Use of reserves is deprecated in favour of holds. See `https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12951/`
** `FreezeIdentifier` -- The ID type for freezes.
** `MaxLocks` -- The maximum number of locks that should exist on an account.
** `MaxReserves` -- The maximum number of named reserves that can exist on an account. Use of reserves is deprecated in favour of holds. See `https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12951/`
** `MaxHolds` -- The maximum number of holds that can exist on an account at any time.
** `MaxFreezes` -- The maximum number of individual freeze locks that can exist on an account at any time.
* Common configs
** `RuntimeEvent` -- The overarching event type.
** `WeightInfo` -- Weight information for extrinsics in this pallet.

[.contract-item]
[[transfer_allow_death]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++transfer_allow_death++#`
[source,rust]
----
pub fn transfer_allow_death(
			origin: OriginFor<T>,
			dest: AccountIdLookupOf<T>,
			#[pallet::compact] value: T::Balance,
		) -> DispatchResult
----
Transfers the `value` from `origin` to `dest`.

NOTE: `allow_death` means, if the account balance drops below ExistentialDeposit, it might be reaped/deleted.


**Params:**

* `origin: OriginFor<T>` -- caller (and in this case, sender) account
* `dest: AccountIdLookupOf<T>` -- recipient
* `value: T::Balance` -- amount to transfer

**Errors:**

* `ErrorName` -- description of conditions, when this error happens

**Events:**

* `EventName(param1, param2)` -- description of event, if needed (they are often self-explanatory)
